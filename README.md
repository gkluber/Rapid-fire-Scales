## Purpose
With the Rapid-fire Scales program, one can draw a random key from a subset of the major keys. This is useful for music theory teachers because it allows them to quiz their students on a set of major keys, whereby the student would be expected to give the major scale for the key displayed by the program. The applet accomplishes this in a neat, visually-appealing manner.
